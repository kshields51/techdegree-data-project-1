 The first project
 
 I am going for exceeds expectations.

Welcome to my number guessing game. The goal is to guess a number between 1 and 100 inclusive. Try to win the game with the lowest number of guesses possible. After the game ends you will be told the total number of guesses, as well as the mean, the median, and the mode of the guesses.
